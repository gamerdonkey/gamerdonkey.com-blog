Coder, maker, science enthusiast, and person pretending to be a donkey on the internet. Not necessarily in that order. I have strong opinions on timezones but enough good sense to not bring them up in casual conversation.

I'm still figuring out what I want to be when I grow up. I am interested in doing more work on escape room electronics or other interactive displays and props. Generally, though, I want to build things that help people learn, grow, and become greater than they otherwise would be.

### > "gamerdonkey"?

I don't know. I came up with it when I was like twelve. I guess I played more games back then and I've just kind of stuck with it since. Don't judge.
