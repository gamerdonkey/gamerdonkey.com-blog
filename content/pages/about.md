# > gamerdonkey

Coder, maker, science enthusiast, and person pretending to be a donkey on the internet. Not necessarily in that order. I have strong opinions on timezones but enough good sense to not bring them up in casual conversation. I'm older than I used to be but still figuring out what I want to be when I grow up.

### > "gamerdonkey"?

I don't know. I came up with it when I was like twelve. I guess I played more games back then. I've just kind of stuck with it since. Don't judge.
