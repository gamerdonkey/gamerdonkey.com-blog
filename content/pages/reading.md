# Here Are Some Books I've Read

This isn't a complete list. I don't want to brag, but I've been reading since I was like 7. I only recently came up with the idea to jot down some thoughts about books I've completed. Actually, I say I came up with the idea, but really I stole it from [elly.town](https://elly.town/).

These may contain mild spoilers, but I won't go heavy into the plot without further warning.

This is the first year I started writing these, so from here on out the reactions are close to live.

## 2022

While looking at my 2023 books, I realized that I started two kind of major book series for me in 2022. So here they are.

1. __*Sourcery* by Sir Terry Pratchett__ - My third read in the Discworld series. Pratchett's writing is just so fun. No other author makes me stop and re-read something just because it's so funny. Even though I don't usually like "powerful child" storylines, I got into this one. I want start the Death storyline next. I love him as a character.

1. __*How To* by Randall Munroe__ - 

1. __*All Systems Red* by Martha Wells__ -

1. __*Gideon the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir__ -

1. __*Artificial Condition* by Martha Wells__ -
